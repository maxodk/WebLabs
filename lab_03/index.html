                        <p>In reality, both sides of the Moon receive the same amount of sunlight; however, only one face is visible from Earth. This occurs because the Moon rotates on its own axis in the same amount of time it takes to orbit Earth, meaning the same side always faces us. The far side has only been observed by spacecraft.</p>

                        <p>The Moon's gravitational pull creates two bulges in the Earth; one on the side facing the Moon and the other on the opposite side. These bulges move around the oceans as the Earth rotates, resulting in high and low tides globally.</p>
